# Puppet Example Repo
This is an example repo to demonstrate how to set up your environment to get it to work with the scripts in the [Puppet-Provisioning](https://github.com/shoddyguard/Puppet-Provisioning) repo.  
There's also some example Puppet modules here that you may find useful.

The most interesting stuff happens in the [hiera.yaml](hiera.yaml) file where we define what our hiera configuration looks like.
