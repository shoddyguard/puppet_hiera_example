# Puppet Example Repo
This is an example repo to demonstrate how to set up your environment to get it to work with the scripts in the [Puppet-Provisioning](https://github.com/shoddyguard/Puppet-Provisioning) repo.  
This branch is fully functioning and should allow you to bootstrap a Puppet6 environment.
