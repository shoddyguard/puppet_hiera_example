# Puppet Example Repo
This is an example repo to demonstrate how to set up your environment to get it to work with the scripts in the [Puppet-Provisioning](https://github.com/shoddyguard/Puppet-Provisioning) repo.  

This branch is a fully functioning example of how to bootstrap a Puppet6 environment using the [puppetmaster.sh](https://github.com/shoddyguard/Puppet-Provisioning/blob/master/puppetmaster.sh) script.
